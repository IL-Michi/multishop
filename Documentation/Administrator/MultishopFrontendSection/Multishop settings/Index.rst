Multishop settings

Configuration instructions
==========================

Now that you have finished the installation procedure and have the Multishop admin panel in front of you it's time to configure Multishop.

In the top right section of the admin panel you can do a wild search. This search engine searches for:

- Multishop settings
- Customers
- Categories
- Products
- Manufacturers
- Orders
- Invoices

We advice you to use the search engine as much as possible to win a lot of time. If you want to see a complete list of settings open SYSTEM / SETTINGS in the bottom right panel.

Define the store name, e-mail address and location
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Now press "Store Name" and change the CURRENT VALUE


Define the enabled countries, zones, shipping and payment methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Go to SYSTEM / SHIPPING AND PAYMENT and press COUNTRIES.

Define here to which countries are able to deliver.

After the countries are enabled it's time to create shipping zones. A shipping zone could contain one or more countries. This makes configuring the shipping costs easier.
