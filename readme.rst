Multishop
=========

Multishop is the e-commerce plugin for TYPO3.

Download official version from TYPO3.org
========================================

`Multishop <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/multishop>`_

Installation
============

Simply install the plugin in your TYPO3 installation.

Usage
=====

After the plugin has been installed the shop must be configured. How you can do this can be read on typo3.org.

jQuery / t3jquery notice
========================
Multishop requires jQuery 2. Also enable the jQuery module: Migrate + all the Bootstrap modules.

Bootstrap 3 required
====================
Multishop expects the website to have Twitter Bootstrap loaded. You will have to load the JavaScript library (with i.e. t3jquery) yourself and manually include Bootstrap.css with TypoScript.

Load bootstrap.css by TypoScript example:
::
	page {
		includeCSS.bootstrapCss = https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css
		includeCSS.bootstrapCss {
			media =
			import = 0
			compress=1
		}
	}
```
	page {
		includeCSS.bootstrapCss = https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css
		includeCSS.bootstrapCss {
			media =
			import = 0
			compress=1
		}
	}
```

Login to your TYPO3 backend:

- Clear TYPO3 cache
- Go to extension manager. Select t3jquery plugin to configure it. Select TYPO in selectbox and configure:

jQuery Version - typo.jQueryVersion: 2.x
jQuery UI Version - typo.jQueryUiVersion: 1.10.x
jQuery TOOLS Version - typo.jQueryTOOLSVersion: 1.2.x
jQuery Bootstrap version - 3.x.x
